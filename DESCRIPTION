Description: A set of functions have been implemented to generate random data to perform Monte Carlo simulations on structural models with formative constructs and interaction and nonlinear effects (Two-Step PLS Mode B structural models). The setup of the true model considers a simple structure with three formative exogenous constructs related to one formative endogenous construct. The routines take into account the interaction and nonlinear effects of the exogenous constructs on the endogenous construct.
